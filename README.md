A common practice in video game development is to develop prototypes to test game designer's hypotheses, run-in game mechanics, and conduct early playtests. The code quality requirements for such projects are often lower, as it is expected to be discarded and completely rewritten. 

 However, in some cases, when a prototype receives positive feedback and has the potential for commercial success, the business may decide not to start development from scratch, but to improve the existing code.

Then such projects face the task of rewriting and refactoring parts of the code to simplify its support and make it easier to add new functions.

This repository demonstrates the process of refactoring and rewriting highly connected and poorly structured code lacking a clear architecture. An open source 3D tank game is used as an example.

The project uses the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach and Zenject for Dependency Injection (DI). The main goal is to show how the source code can be transformed to become more maintainable and easily extensible to add new features.
